            `<h2>LAMBORGHINI AVENTADOR SVJ ROADSTER</h2>
                <p>Unveiled at the 2018 Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance, the Aventador SVJ (Super Veloce Jota) is a track focused iteration of the Aventador S and an improvement over the Aventador SV. The 6.5-litre L539 V12 engine used in the entire Aventador lineage has been reworked and now generates a maximum power output of 770 PS (566 kW; 759 hp) at 8,500 rpm and 720 N⋅m (531 lb⋅ft) of torque at 6,750 rpm. The weight saving measures such as the extensive use of carbon fibre, and titanium in the exhaust system has brought the weight down to 1,525 kg (3,362 lb), giving the car a power-to-weight ratio of 0.5 hp/kg. The Aventador SVJ can accelerate from 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) in 2.8 seconds and 0–200 km/h (0–124 mph) in 8.6 seconds and can attain a top speed of over 352 km/h (219 mph).</p>
                <p>The Aventador SVJ is the first production V12 Lamborghini model to feature Lamborghini's Aerodinamica Lamborghini Attiva (ALA) system. This allows the car to achieve 40% more downforce than the Aventador SV and 1% reduction in the coefficient of drag. The system adds aerodynamic components to the car including a disconnected front splitter, tri-dimensional air outlet on the bonnet, a large carbon fibre rear wing with a central fin, underbody aero design with vortex generators, and a large rear diffuser. The system works in conjunction with Lamborghini Dinamica Veicolo Attiva 2.0 (LDVA 2.0) management system, which uses inertial sensors to control the car's aero in 500 milliseconds.</p>
                <p>The Aventador SVJ "63 Edition", a special edition commemorating the company's year of foundation (1963), featuring a special white livery with the number 63 more prominent on the car would be first offered for sale and limited to just 63 units, while the whole production run of the Aventador SVJ would be limited to just 963 units in total including the 63 units, with deliveries starting in the beginning of 2019</p>
